	* encodeTitle(): Support of multibyte encodings like UTF-8 in the encoding of page titles. Also extended letters => ASCII equivalents are working now (using t3lib_cs)
	* Implemented support for usage over multiple domains. Manual has been updated. Basically you have to configure the id-resolver (like "tx_realurl_advanced") to know of its root page id so it has a starting point. This is cannot be automatic and therefore you have to configure it to correspond with the root page UID in the page tree. This is documented with examples in the manual.
	* !!! Changed return values type for some functions, in particular observe that the user processing of path-to-id is now returning and ARRAY NOT AN INTEGER (Id)!
	* &MP vars are now encoded with page id. Works with both pagepath cache and without.
	* Generally, the manual URL decoding (without pagepath cache) has been updated and tested to work well.
	* Fixed bug with ".html" prefix when page path is blank
	(This development was sponsored by Forbrugernes Hus in Denmark. Thanks.)

	* Added option to disable pathcache (and more for that)
	* For 404 handling, realurl will now use the default TYPO# pageNotFound handling.
	* "Admin" jump functionality had a new feature which can link people into the backend for editing the page rather than showing frontend icons only.
	* Created modes for "soft" segment-not-found handling.
	* Implemented true URL decode/encode caching
	* All document, but some features depends on TYPO3 3.7.0-dev+

	* Added new option "appendMissingSlash" which appends a trailing slash to the path if it was not set by the user.

	* Added the possibility of specifying more than just the "nav_title,title" fields from the rootline in the generation/resolve of the speaking URL. Documentation updated accordingly.
