Notes...:

- overall caching.

FEATURES:
- NA value / null setting
- Re-think "condition" on previous value; more options?
- Add user-processing various places.
- Required-GETvars on postVarSets... (instead of taking the postVarSet if just a SINGLE Getvar matches...?)
- alias identification made unique / "safe" with hash tabel for any look-up table? (same for pages)
caching of URLs / domain binding?

- cHash handling? (only needed if cHash is the ONLY parameter left?)
	- &MP should be encoded with page id!

	- Implement alternative method in another extension. (automatic...)
	- Adding a field to "Pages" which is unique within a PID
	- Forward analysis: first SpURL field, then alias, then check page title.
	- Caching of path (using common interface for that) (maybe not, just keep it totally "dynamic"!)
	- Finding root page by look up a) on domain first, then b) by template record PIDs page titles/SpURL fields.

- encodeTitle(): Support of multibyte encodings like UTF-8 in the encoding of page titles.
- Update documentation feature list + screenshot for introduction.



Todo:
- 404 handling?
- Encoding of remaining parameters (M5/B6) (Probably not needed since the whole idea of encoding is obsolete by using Speaking URLs!)
- Handling of situations with multiple sites where no domain is used; Maybe look up pages NOT only in pid=0 but also which has a template record with the root-flag set!
