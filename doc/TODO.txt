Todo:
- 404 handling?
- Encoding of remaining parameters (M5/B6) (Probably not needed since the whole idea of encoding is obsolete by using Speaking URLs!)
- Handling of situations with multiple sites where no domain is used; Maybe look up pages NOT only in pid=0 but also which has a template record with the root-flag set!
- Update documentation feature list + screenshot for introduction.
- encodeTitle(): Support of multibyte encodings like UTF-8 in the encoding of page titles.
- &MP should be encoded with page id!
- Add user-processing various places.
- Required-GETvars on postVarSets... (instead of taking the postVarSet if just a SINGLE Getvar matches...?)
- Implement URL caching: decodeSpURL_decodeCache()
- NA value / null setting
- Multiple sites in the same database? Binding cached records/paths to domains or?

Todo for uniqalias table:
- Create backend facilities which makes it possible to modify/create new aliases associated with ids; This way the automatically created aliases can be customized afterwards.


Alternative flow for page ID resolve (idea):
	- Adding a "SpURL" field to "Pages" which is unique within a PID
	- Forward analysis: first "SpURL" field, then alias, then check page title.
	- Finding root page by look up a) on domain first, then b) by template record PIDs page titles/SpURL fields.
